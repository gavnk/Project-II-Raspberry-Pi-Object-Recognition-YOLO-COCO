# Neural-Network-for-Object-Detection

This project was a 2nd year university project 2021-2022. The project was to gain experience with computer vision,
before officially being taught. The goal was to satisfy one the SDG's, use a raspberry pi and a camera.
The global issue found was that waste sorting was still carried out by manual labor, so a way to help automate this became the project.

An object detection of recyclables and/or waste using an edge device was chosen.

While the project was successful at object detection, due to time, the project didn't go beyond the initial working version, it used just the COCO dataset and not one of waste objects and therefore was not good at recognition of waste. However, the key takeaway was a self-taught crash course in computer vision on an edge device, introduction to computer vision algorithms and software, object detection, machine learning, and the importance of datasets.
